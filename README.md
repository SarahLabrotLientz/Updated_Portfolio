# Updated_Portfolio
Sarah Labrot's updated portfolio with mobile responsive features, animation, and a downloadable resume. Additional features include links to my LinkedIn, Github and Instagram accounts. 

Directions for future development:

I would like to scrap this site and create something with dry code. My creative process got a bit messy and while i'm happy with the outward appearence I would like to explore bulma for a new css outlet. I would also like to see more models in my portolio section. I initially had 6 but the code got messy and I ultimately decided to go with simplicity.
